This is Mate1 programming exercise
=================================

Feature List:
-------------
1. I have implemented most of required part except secure communication for producers.
2. backend fully developed by Scala/AKKA in play framework 2.3.9 which is stateless web Tier and RESTful by default
3. front-end developed by Javascript (and JQuery for communication with server) 
4. The backend computation all handle by actors and through asynchronous message passing without any blocking.
5. To build a scalable system, we create an actor for each topic which is responsible for serving all the events production/consumption. 
6. previously mentioned actor are supervised by another actor which is in charge of creating new topic. 
7. All the actors servers as the model part of MVC architecture.
8. Since system's data and state are kept in memory, I have tried to use persistent actor to increase the system fault-tolerance; however, this library is still experimental an I had problems for resolving its dependencies (Anyway, I will definitely add the persistence actor in this project as a good use case for Akka persistency)


Development Mode Execution:
-------------
1. Download the project and unzip it on your machine.
2. change your working directory and go inside the extracted file.
3. On Unix machines execute command "./activator run" (on windows activator.bat run) to start the server.
4. server start working and listening on port 9000.
5.1 in your browser type address http://localhost:9000 to start as a consumer.
5.2 in your browser type address http://localhost:9000/producers to start as producer.

6. there is a dropdown in each page which represents topics.
7.1 in producer page you can create new topic by selecting "create new" in dropdown and filling the topic name.
7.2 in producer page you can create new event for a topic by selecting topic and filling the event name.
7.3 in consumer page you can fetch events of a topic by selecting the topic from dropdown and fetching each event by clicking "next" button which will show up. 


Production Mode Execution:
-------------
1. complete the first two step of "development mode execution".
2. On Unix machines execute command "./activator dist" (on windows "activator.bat dist") to create production executive file.
3. Go to "target/universal/" 
4. extract "hyperqueue-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip" file.
5. go to extracted folder -> bin 
6. execute file hyperqueue ("./hyperqueue")
6.1 you can specify the server port through -Dhttp.port=9443 argument.
